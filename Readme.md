# Energy Consumption Analytics

## Overview

The energy consumption analytics project aims to analyze and derive insights from energy consumption data to inform decision-making related to energy management and sustainability. Leveraging data analytics techniques, the project focuses on understanding energy consumption patterns, identifying trends, and exploring opportunities for optimization.

## Analysis

The analysis involves several key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, filtering, and formatting raw energy consumption data to prepare it for analysis.

2. **Statistical Analysis**: Computing descriptive statistics, trends, and correlations to gain insights into energy consumption patterns and drivers.

3. **Visualization**: Creating visual representations such as charts, graphs, and maps to effectively communicate findings and trends in energy consumption.

4. **Modeling**: Developing predictive models, such as linear regression or time series forecasting, to forecast future energy consumption based on historical data and external factors.

## Insights

The analytics provide valuable insights into:

- Energy consumption trends over time.
- Regional variations in energy usage.
- Factors influencing peak demand and energy consumption spikes.
- Predictive models for forecasting energy consumption and demand.
